\title{Text summary for a taxonomic rank}
\usage{
taxa_summary_text(
  physeq,
  taxonomic_rank = "currentCanonicalSimple",
  taxnames = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  min_nb_seq = 0,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{A phyloseq object}

\item{taxonomic_rank}{(Character, default "currentCanonicalSimple")
The column(s) present in the @tax_table slot of the phyloseq object. Can
be a vector of two columns (e.g. c("Genus", "Species")).}

\item{taxnames}{(A character vector of taxonomic names to select)}

\item{verbose}{(logical, default TRUE) If TRUE, prompt some messages.}

\item{min_nb_seq}{minimum number of sequences by OTUs by
samples to take into count this OTUs in this sample. For example,
if min_nb_seq=2,each value of 2 or less in the OTU table
will not count in the venn diagram}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to [subset_taxa_pq()].}
}
\value{
A character string summarizing the number of samples, taxa, sequences and occurrences of the selected taxa.
}
\description{
Create a text to summarize the number of samples, taxa, sequences and occurrences of selected taxa in a phyloseq object for a given value in the column of a tax_table
}
